      "Hello my name is sanjana shedge student of(F.y. B pharm) today where I m is just becoz of dr.madhu mam she really gave her best during lectures becoz of that today I'm studying in good college. I still remember mam's first lecture how she introduced herself and gave us short career guidance in a very easy way. Mam is so pure hearted, she nevers shouts on anyone always comes to each student asks hows ur study going, what difficulties ur facing... And always in last solves all our doubts problem.. She is just not taking boards for granted she says just do from both I'll teach u in balance way and really help me.. Becoz not only the ncert but boards are also having the same content and just there's a minor change in ans so not to have confusion on mht cet Or neet day, therefore she taught us in very interesting way. Mam also take question practice session she use to give us the dpp day before starting of new chapter just to do it by ourselves but it's not like given dpps and done. She asks us the next, crosschecks the answers with everyone and tells what's the correct ans and why it's wrong becoz sometimes what happened is that we think 2 option for that question are same and we tick the wrong one. So not to happen anything like this she really helped me a lot.. Really I m thankful to u mam that u taught me biology thankyou so much mam",

      'Dr. Madhu mam is an excellent teacher. She teaches biology in very simple and beautiful way. As other subjects  are also there , all the teachers are very good in their subjects . I ü§î biology subject is very tough. As it is very expanded one (subject). So,  Madhu Mam teaches it very calmly and in an excellent way. The concepts (of mam)are very clear  so, she know that how she can teach to students. That everyone can learn and boost their knowledge. She also gives motivational speeches every week that boost us and touch our üíï .',

      'Dr. Madhu has a very unique style of teaching the subjects. She makes us understand the concepts in very simple words. She is very kind by nature and a person of simplicity and great thoughts.  She has a special art of relating things with live examples which helps us to understand concepts easily. The assignment and exercises she gives on daily basis are so relatable that our concepts get very much clear and sorted.',
